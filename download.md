I started writing musicsaur in Python, but have also ported it to Golang. There are different ways to get started with **musicsaur** depending on what you want to do:

### Do you want download, install Python libraries, and run?

Then follow [these instructions](/python/) to get going with the Python version.

### Do you want download, install Go libraries, and run?

Then follow [these instructions](/golang/) to get going with the Go version.
